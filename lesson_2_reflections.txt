Q1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When I initialize a new repository it creates a .git folder which contains meta data about the changes I've made e.g. commit records
    When I start a new one, I need to do git init then git status to see what's inside it

Q2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is different to the working directory in that it acts as a mid-way point to choose what to add into a commit before you actually do it. 
    It acts as a logical separation in case you want to revert files you want to addd to the commit

    **Does this appear in the commit?**
